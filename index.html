<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p> 
<h2>Why should you play?</h2>
<p>This game is a fun and active way of improving your memory and concentration. It is a particularly good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating as well. The scheme can be employed as an educational game, thus teachers and trainers can incorporate it in their classroom delivery.</p>
